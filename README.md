<h1 align="center">
  Github action for deploying the Django project to Elastic beanstalk after running some basic continuous integrations.
</h1>

<p align="center">
  This <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Action</a> will deploy your Django project to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">AWS Elastic beanstalk</a>. It can be configured to upload your production-ready code into any branch you'd like, and even make multiple deployments it to different environments like staging or uat environments. You can also run linting, testing and security checks before deploying. And also you can download the reports of the coverage and the security checks as artifacts.
</p>

This action has the following features:
- Deploy Django project to elasticbeanstalk.
- Run unit tests.
- Download coverage reports.
- Run security checks using bandit.
- Download security checks report.
- Run linting using flake8.

## Usage

It is **important** to have the Elastic beanstalk `config.yml` of your project with its AWS credentials.

```yml
    - name: Django aws eb deployment
      uses: joel-hanson/django-aws-eb-deploy@V1.1
      with:
        python_version: ${{ matrix.python_version }}
        flake8: true
        aws_access_key_id: ${{ secrets.aws_access_key_id }}
        aws_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.aws_secret_access_key }}
        django_path: sample_project
        unit_testing: true
        deploy: true
        min_coverage: 10
        postgresql_required: true
        security_check: true
        flake8_config_file: "sample_project/.flake8"
```


### Getting Started :airplane:

You can include the action in your workflow to trigger on any event that [GitHub actions supports](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows). If the remote branch that you wish to deploy to doesn't already exist the action will create it for you. Your workflow will also need to include the `actions/checkout` step before this workflow runs in order for the deployment to work.


#### Example

You can view an example of this below.

```yml
name: Build and Deployment

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python_version: [3.7.17]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Django aws eb deployment
      uses: joel-hanson/django-aws-eb-deploy@V1.1
      with:
        python_version: ${{ matrix.python_version }}
        flake8: true
        aws_access_key_id: ${{ secrets.aws_access_key_id }}
        aws_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.aws_secret_access_key }}
        django_path: sample_project
        unit_testing: true
        deploy: true
        min_coverage: 10
        postgresql_required: true
        security_check: true
        flake8_config_file: "sample_project/.flake8"

```

If you'd like to make it so the workflow only triggers on push events to specific branches then you can modify the `on` section.

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
```

### Configuration 📁

The `with` portion of the workflow **must** be configured before the action will work. You can add these in the `with` section found in the examples above. Any `secrets` must be referenced using the bracket syntax and stored in the GitHub repositories `Settings/Secrets` menu. You can learn more about setting environment variables with GitHub actions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv).

#### Required Setup

One of the following deployment options must be configured.

### Operating System Support 💿

This action is primarily developed using [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). [In your workflow job configuration](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on) it's recommended to set the `runs-on` property to `ubuntu-latest`.

```yml
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

### Artifacts 📁

You can get the report for the coverage and the bandit security checks reports for you django project. [learn more about artifacts](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts).
